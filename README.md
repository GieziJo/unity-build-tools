Tools to automate and streamline Unity builds

## Enhanced Build Tools

The enhanced build tool lets you setup multiple builds at once, save them for later use, and batch them.

Usually, for each you'd need to switch platform, change the scripting define symbols manually, wait for compilation, and repeat. For a medium-large project that supports multiple platforms and stores, such as Oath to the Stars, that means a long time wasted waiting for Unity to do its work.

Using this tool, all the setup work will be done just once, and the necessary builds will be generated just by pressing a button, with no further input required:
